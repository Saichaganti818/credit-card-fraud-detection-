Based on the study of various papers published between 1994 and 2018 on credit card fraud, the following objectives are achieved: 
the various types of credit card frauds have identified and to detect automatically these frauds, an adaptive machine learning techniques (AMLTs) has studied and also their pros and cons has summarized.
